1. Exception logging pattern

In the logjira paper, we find that developers are confused about exception logging in many cases. They are confused about
the whether to log, the log level, and whether to log the stack trace.

We can leverage the logging-plugin to find the logging patterns for each methodCall-exception pairs.
For example, if a openFile method call triggers an IOException, then we can look at the logging patterns for
the openFile -> IOException scenarios. Hopefully, they should be logged similarly.

We can add other metrics, such as the number of containing loops, the number of method calls in the try block,
and whether the exception is handled.
